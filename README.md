# CPSC304 Project (Group 34)

This is the CPSC304 project of Group 34 with Elliott Au, Devin Huang and David Lin.

This project is a database about Canadaâ€™s Parliament. This database will store information about our cabinet members, MPs, and senators and their voting records on specific bills, along with past election data. The system will be available for anyone so they can easily and quickly find information about what policies certain politicians have supported, and not supported in the past in order to make more informed decisions during elections so the people can ensure the politicians they vote for align with their personal values.
